This C# form app is designed for encryption and decryption using RSA algorithm.

In main page, user can choose the key size between 2048 and 1024.

In encryption page, by pressing _Publish_ key both public and private keys will be generated and user can the _Public key_ in front of that. Now user can enter the _Plaintext_ and by pressing _START ENCRYPTION_, the encrypted text (ciphertext) will be shown as a pop-up message. Also, the ciphertext and the public key will be saved as a txt file.

In decryption page, user needs to enter the _Ciphertext_ and the _public Key_ and by pressing _START DECRYPTION_, the decrypted text (plaintext) will be shown as a pop-up message.
